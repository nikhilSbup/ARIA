Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a sick leave for the next [number of days] days as I am currently unwell and unable to attend school.

I am suffering from [briefly mention your illness or ailment, e.g. fever, flu, etc.]. My doctor has advised me to take some rest and avoid any strenuous activities for the time being. Unfortunately, this means that I will be unable to attend school for the next [number of days] days.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will also ensure that I complete all my assignments and projects on time.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make up for the missed days. I appreciate your understanding and support during this time.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
